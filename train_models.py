    """
    This function trains multiple machine learning models on various subsets of the input dataset, 
    performs hyperparameter tuning, evaluates the models, and saves the results.

    Parameters:
        x_data: dict
            A dictionary containing the feature data split into sections and subsections 
            (e.g., {"section1": {"subsection1": X_data, "subsection2": X_data}}).
            Each subsection represents a different feature subset for training the models.
        
        y: pd.DataFrame
            The target labels for the dataset.
        
        path: str
            The directory path where output files, such as confusion matrix images, will be saved.
        
        name: str
            A descriptive name for the experiment (currently unused but can be used for logging or saving results).

    Workflow:
        - Splits each subsection of data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
        - Iterates over a list of models and their respective hyperparameters.
        - Calls `classification_parameter_finder` to train, tune, and evaluate each model.
        - Stores the results for each model and dataset combination.

    Output:
        - Results are saved in a CSV file named `result.csv` in the local directory.
        - Confusion matrices and related artifacts are saved to the specified `path`.
        - Prints progress and completion messages to the console for monitoring.

    Notes:
        - This function assumes that the `get_details_models()` function provides a list of tuples, 
          each containing a model instance and its corresponding hyperparameter grid.
        - Suppresses warnings related to model convergence (e.g., ConvergenceWarning).
